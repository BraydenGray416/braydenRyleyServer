# Portfolio Server
To run this project, you need the server as well. That can be found at: [braydenRyleyFrontEnd](https://github.com/BraydenGray416/braydenRyleyFrontEnd). The process for setting that all up will be over on that Git repository.
Clone down the project and direct into the files through your chosen Terminal. Make sure that you have Node JS and Grunt both installed into your project. Once in the folder, enter into your server:
```
npm install
```
Once the node modules are installed, open up the files in your chosen code editor and rename the **configExample.json** to **config.json**. Inside the newly renamed file, enter in the login for the Mongo database.

From here, you should be good to go.
